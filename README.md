A little about myself:
I am a masters student!
I am a software engineer!
Some of my hobbies include:
- Traveling! I love visiting new places and trying new foods (I’m definitely a foodie). Fun fact I have visited 15 countries and my most recent trip was to Spain!
- Sports! I’m really into Ice Hockey as I used to play as a kid, and I am a big Leafs fan (lol I know). I also am learning how to play tennis which I’m loving!
- Gaming! I enjoy playing games every now and then with friends.
- Music! I love listening to new artists and recently I picked the guitar back up!
